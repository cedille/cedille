** Qmaybe
- switching from "safe" to "fast" trie-lookup makes the program half as slow (~2 secs to ~4 secs) and also doubles the percentage of time used up by Qmaybe. this suggests that the problem with the fast method is that there are many more pattern matches on Just|Nothing. this also suggests that this part of the code is indeed important in terms of performance, since its so sensitive to the change in this code

  the code that accounts for 30% (61% resp.) of the time is called "$mC14" and is:
  `pattern C14 a0 = Just a0`
  the runner up accounts for 10% (10% resp.) of the time, called "$mC12", and is:
  `pattern C12 = Nothing`
  the third highest accounts for 6% (2% resp.) of the time, called "du12", and is:
  `du12 v0 v1`
  with name: name12 = "trie.cal-lookup"
- found a cost centre that seems interesting:
