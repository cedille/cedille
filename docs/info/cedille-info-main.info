7 Context buffer
****************

The context buffer for Cedille allows the user to see the local
variables in scope for the currently selected node.  To display the
context buffer, select a node and press 'C'; this will open the context
buffer and jump to it.  If you just want to open the context buffer (but
not jump to it), press 'c' instead.

   The context buffer has several built-in features to organize data:

   * Sort entries alphabetically or by binding position

   * Filter entries according to common properties.  Only one filter may
     be active at a time.

   * Show or hide shadowed variables

8 Controls
**********

'a/z'
     Sort all entries alphabetically from a-z/z-a

'd/u'
     Sort all entries according to binding position in parse tree
     (descending/ascending)

'e'
     Filter out entries that do not have an '≃' symbol

'E'
     Filter out entries that are not literal statements of β-equality

'f'
     Clear current filter so all entries are shown

's'
     Toggle display of shadowed variables

'w'
     Hide or unhide type or kind of line currently under cursor

'W'
     Unhide all types and kinds hidden with 'w'

'c/C'
     Close the context mode window

'h'
     Open information page for context mode

9 Common commands
*****************

'M-c'
     Copy the contents of the current buffer to the scratch buffer

'+'
     Increase the size of the buffer by one line

'-'
     Decrease the size of the buffer by one line

'='
     Reset the buffer's size

'f'
     Moves to the next defined variable in the buffer

'b'
     Moves to the previous defined variable in the buffer

'a'
     Moves to the first defined variable in the buffer

'e'
     Moves to the last defined variable in the buffer

11 cedille-mode options
***********************

The options file resides in ~/.cedille/options and consists of a list of
options, each on its own line, with a terminating period (".").  The
available options are:

'import-directories "/path/to/dir"'
     This specifies a directory where Cedille will search for imported
     files.  Any number of directories may be listed, each on its own
     line.  They will be searched after the current directory.
     Currently, it is not recommended to have two files with the same
     name.

'use-cede-files = [true/false]'
     Enables/disables the Cedille backend's use of .cede files

'make-rkt-files = [true/false]'
     Enables/disables the Cedille backend's generation of .rkt files

'generate-logs = [true/false]'
     Enables/disables generation of log files (.cedille/log)

'show-qualified-vars = [true/false]'
     Enables/disables the printing of fully-qualified variables

'erase-types = [true/false]'
     Sets whether or not types are erased before they are displayed, for
     convenience.

12 Cedille's Type Theory
************************

Cedille's type theory is called the Calculus of Dependent Lambda
Eliminations (CDLE). It is somewhat rare in being a Curry-style type
theory.  Coq and Agda are based on Church-style theories.  The
difference is that in a Curry-style (aka extrinsic) type theory, type
annotations are merely hints to the type checker, and the "real" terms
(the subjects of metatheoretic analysis, for example) are completely
unannotated.  Thus, such annotations can be erased during compilation
and during formal reasoning (in particular during conversion checking,
where the type checker tests whether two terms are definitionally
equal).  In contrast, with Church-style (aka intrinsic) type theory, the
annotations are "really there", and must be preserved during compilation
and conversion.

12.1 Example
============

For an example, consider the term Λ X : ★ .  λ x : X .  x.  In
Church-style type theory, the annotations giving the classifiers for X
and x are truly part of the term, and the theory itself does not allow
for them to be erased.  In contrast, in a Curry-style type theory like
CDLE, those annotations are just hints to help the type checker see how
to assign the type ∀ X : ★ .  X ➔ X to λ x .  x.  The type theory has a
notion of erasure, and conversion compares the erasures of terms rather
than the annotated terms.

12.2 Cedille extends the Calculus of Constructions
==================================================

The starting point for Cedille is a Curry-style version of the Calculus
of Constructions (CC). Coq is based on several extensions of CC, notably
with a predicative universe hierarchy (Luo's Extended Calculus of
Constructions), and with a primitive system of inductive datatypes (the
Calculus of Inductive Constructions of Paulin-Mohring and Werner).
Cedille has neither the universe hierarchy nor the inductive types.  The
universe hierarchy is omitted to avoid additional metatheoretic and
implementation complexity, which has not been justified to my (Aaron's)
satisfaction by examples.  So it is omitted not for any really
fundamental reason (that we know of).  Omitting the system of primitive
inductive types, however, is one of the chief goals of Cedille, and will
be discussed more below.

12.3 The type constructs of Cedille
===================================

From CC, Cedille inherits the following type constructs:

   * ∀ X : 𝒌 .  T - this is impredicative quantification over types X of
     kind 𝒌.
   * Π x : T .  T' - this is dependent function space, where the return
     type T' may mention the input argument x.
   * λ X : 𝒌 .  T - this is a type-level function over types X of kind
     𝒌.
   * λ x : T .  T' - this is a type-level function over terms x of type
     T.
   * T t - this is applying a type-level function T to a term t.
   * T T' - this is applying a type-level function T to a type T'.
   * X - type variables are types, of course.

   See *Note unicode shortcuts:: for how to type these symbols in
Cedille mode.

   To the above constructs, Cedille adds:

12.4 More reading
=================

The syntax and semantics of Cedille are described in this document on
arXiv (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04709).

   The paper first showing how to derive induction for an inductive type
in Cedille is here (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apal.2018.03.002).

13 Minor-mode buffers for Cedille
*********************************

Cedille uses several extra buffers to provide information about the
processed Cedille source file:

* Menu:

* inspect buffer::              Provides information about the currently selected node
* context buffer::                Displays the types and kinds of all variables in the scope of the selected node
* summary buffer::                Displays the types and kinds of every top-level entity in the file
* meta-vars buffer::              Displays the meta-variables at the current position in an application spine
* beta-reduce mode::            Beta-reduction explorer

The inspect buffer for Cedille provides basic information about a node.
To display the inspect buffer, select a node and press 'I' and you will
open up the inspect buffer and jump to it.  If you just want to open the
inspect buffer (but not jump to it), press 'i' instead.

   The inspect buffer contains information about the selected node, and
is automatically updated during navigation.
