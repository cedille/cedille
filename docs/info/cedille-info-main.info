1 Cedille’s Type Theory
***********************

Cedille’s type theory is called the Calculus of Dependent Lambda
Eliminations (CDLE). It is somewhat rare in being a Curry-style type
theory.  Coq and Agda are based on Church-style theories.  The
difference is that in a Curry-style (aka extrinsic) type theory, type
annotations are merely hints to the type checker, and the “real” terms
(the subjects of metatheoretic analysis, for example) are completely
unannotated.  Thus, such annotations can be erased during compilation
and during formal reasoning; in particular during conversion checking,
where the type checker tests whether two terms are definitionally equal.
In contrast, with Church-style (aka intrinsic) type theory, the
annotations are “really there”, and must be preserved during compilation
and conversion.

For an example, consider the polymorphic identity function Λ X : ★ .  λ
x : X .  x.  In Church-style type theory, the binder introducting the
type variable X and the annotation giving the classifier for x are truly
part of the term, and the theory itself does not allow for them to be
erased.  In contrast, in a Curry-style type theory like CDLE, those
annotations are just hints to help the type checker see how to assign
the type ∀ X : ★ .  X ➔ X to λ x .  x.  The type theory has a notion of
erasure, and conversion compares the erasures of terms rather than the
annotated terms.

1.1 Cedille extends the Calculus of Constructions
=================================================

The starting point for Cedille is a Curry-style version of the Calculus
of Constructions (CC). Coq is based on several extensions of CC, notably
with a predicative universe hierarchy (Luo’s Extended Calculus of
Constructions), and with a primitive system of inductive datatypes (the
Calculus of Inductive Constructions of Paulin-Mohring and Werner).
Cedille has neither the universe hierarchy nor the inductive types.  The
universe hierarchy is omitted to avoid additional metatheoretic and
implementation complexity, which has not been justified to my (Aaron’s)
satisfaction by examples.  So it is omitted not for any really
fundamental reason (that we know of).  Omitting the system of primitive
inductive types, however, is one of the chief goals of Cedille, and will
be discussed more below.

The language is divided into three layers: terms, types, and kinds.
Terms are the programs we intend eventually to execute, or to use as
proofs.  Types describe programs, and under the Curry-Howard isomorphism
which Cedille makes use of, can be seen as formulas to be proved.  Kinds
are the classifiers for types.  So in Cedille we have

term : type : kind

1.2 The type constructs of Cedille
==================================

From CC, Cedille inherits the following type constructs:

   • ∀ X : 𝒌 .  T – this is impredicative quantification over types X of
     kind 𝒌.
   • Π x : T .  T’ – this is dependent function space, where the return
     type T’ may mention the input argument x.
   • λ X : 𝒌 .  T – this is a type-level function over types X of kind
     𝒌.
   • λ x : T .  T’ – this is a type-level function over terms x of type
     T.
   • T t – this is applying a type-level function T to a term t.
   • T · T’ – this is applying a type-level function T to a type T’
     (note the required center dot).
   • X – type variables are types, of course.

See *note unicode shortcuts:: for how to type these symbols in Cedille
mode.

To the above constructs, Cedille adds the following, discussed more
below:

   • ι x : T .  T’ – dependent intersection of T and T’, where T’ may
     contain x.
   • { t ≃ t’ } – untyped equality between terms t and t’.
   • ∀ x : T .  T’ – the dependent type for functions taking in an
     erased argument x of type T (aka implicit product)

1.2.1 Dependent intersections
-----------------------------

In (Curry-style) type theory, an intersection type T ∩ T’ can be
assigned to a term t iff both T and T’ separately can be assigned to t.
Dependent intersection types, introduced by Kopylov in this paper
(https://doi.org/10.1109/LICS.2003.1210048), extend this idea to allow
the type T’ to reference the term t (i.e., the subject of typing) via a
bound variable x.  Kopylov’s notation for this is x : T ∩ T’.  Cedille
uses the notation ι x : T .  T’ for the same concept.

One very helpful way to think of these types is that they allow the type
T’ of t to refer to t itself, but through a weaker view; namely, the
type T. So if you are writing some function f, say, the type T’ you give
for f can mention f itself – which seems insane (as in insane dependent
typing) – but sanity is preserved by the fact that T’ is only allowed to
reference f through some other type T.

In Cedille, dependent intersections are used to derive inductive
datatypes, using a critical observation of Leivant’s from this paper
(https://doi.org/10.1109/SFCS.1983.50).  Suppose one is trying to prove
the natural-number induction principle for a specific number N; that is,
for any predicate P on natural numbers, if the base and steps cases
hold, then P holds for N. What would the proof look like for this?  One
would assume predicate P, assume P 0 (base case) and ∀ n : Nat .  P n ➔
P (S n) (step case), and prove P N by apply the step case N times to the
base case.  Leivant’s remarkable observation is that this proof, seen
through the lens of the Curry-Howard isomorphism, is

Λ P .  λ z .  λ s .  s (...  (s z))

where s is applied N times.  This erases exactly to the Church-encoding
of N. This means that using the Church-encoding we can view a number N
two ways: as an iterator of type ∀ X : ★ .  X ➔ (X ➔ X) ➔ X – call this
type cNat – and as a proof of its own induction principle, which we can
see as some kind of dependent enrichment of the first type:

∀ P : cNat ➔ ★ .  P 0 ➔ (∀ n : cNat .  P n ➔ P (S n)) ➔ P N

Calling this second type, as a predicate on N, Inductive, the crucial
role of dependent intersection types is to allow us to define Nat as

ι N : cNat.  Inductive N

This definition seems to allow one to prove universality of predicates
on cNats – not Nats!  But universality of Nat-predicates turns out to
follow from this, in several different ways.  See
language-overview/induction-for-church-nats.ced for one example.

1.2.2 Primitive equality between untyped terms
----------------------------------------------

The type { t ≃ t’ } is a primitive equality type, between untyped terms.
The meaning of such a type is that t and t’ are beta-eta equal (where
any necessary instantiations of variables bound outside the equation are
applied to t and t’).  Cedille provides a primitive operation to rewrite
with such equalities (namely ρ), and to prove them when the sides of the
equation can be seen themselves to be beta-eta equal (without
instantiating variables bound outside the equation); this is β.

In more detail: whenever t and t’ are beta-eta equal, the
type-assignment system of CDLE considers any term to inhabit type { t ≃
t’ }.  In Cedille, β is an annotated term inhabiting that type; β itself
erases to λ x .  x.  If one wishes to pick a different unannotated term
t1 to inhabit an obviously true equation like this, then one writes
β{t1}.  We call this the Kleene trick, after Stephen Cole Kleene’s
similar approach to realizing true equations by any number whatsoever.
Here, any term proves an obviously true equation.  This has the
intriguing side effect of giving Cedille a type for all terms, even ones
otherwise untypable.  Thus Cedille is Turing-complete: any closed term
can be assigned type { λ x .  x ≃ λ x .  x }.  In principle type
checking becomes undecidable at this point, because checking whether two
terms of pure untyped lambda calculus are beta-eta equal is undecidable.
In practice, however, we think of the type checker as having some bound
on the number of steps of beta-eta-normalization it will perform on the
sides before testing for alpha-equivalence.  This bound is currently up
to the user to enforce by terminating the tool if it is taking too long.

Rewriting is performed by a construct ρ t - t’.  Here, t should prove an
equation { t1 ≃ t2 }.  Then the type synthesized from or used to check
t’ will be rewritten to replace any subterm beta-eta equal to t1 with
t2.

See language-overview/equational-reasoning.ced for examples.

1.2.3 Implicit products
-----------------------

For unannotated terms, the type ∀ x : T .  T’ introduces x of type T
into the typing context, but otherwise does not affect the subject of
typing.  So such an x is purely specificational, and cannot appear in
the unannotated term.  In annotated terms, we use the construct Λ x : T
.  t to introduce this x, which may appear in annotations (only).  An
example is specifying the length of a vector as an erased argument to a
function like map on vectors.  In this case, the function does not need
to use the length of the vector to compute the result.  The length is
only used specificationally, to state that the lengths of the input and
output vectors are the same.

If one has a term t of type ∀ x : T .  T’ and wishes to instantiate x
with some term t’, the notation in Cedille is t -t’.

2 Architecture of Cedille
*************************

Cedille is implemented in around 13kloc of elisp + Agda.  There is an
emacs Cedille mode for reading and writing Cedille code using *note
unicode shortcuts::.  Most importantly, from Cedille mode one can
request that the Cedille backend process the current Cedille source
buffer, and enter Cedille navigation mode.  In Cedille navigation mode,
a rich amount of type information computed from the backend is available
and can be viewed node by node of the abstract syntax tree for the text
of the buffer.  One navigates this tree using individual keystrokes (in
Cedille navigation mode) like p and n.  One can also issue interactive
commands, even use a beta-reduction explorer.  *Note cedille mode
commands:: There are several *note extra buffers:: available to display
information about the current node (the inspect buffer), current typing
context, meta-variable solutions, and summary information for the source
file.

Additionally, one can request that Cedille compile a given source buffer
and its dependencies to Cedille Core, a much more minimalistic core type
theory lacking many of the nice features of Cedille, especially
spine-local type inference.  ‘core’ contains an implementation of
Cedille Core in Haskell.  There is a specification of Cedille Core here
(https://github.com/astump/cedille-core-spec).

2.1 Spans
=========

The frontend (i.e., the emacs mode) sends request to the backend in a
simple text format.  The backend replies with _spans_, which consist of
a starting and ending character position in the file, a name for the
node, and a list of attribute-value pairs.  The inspect buffer, which
one views with keystroke <i> when a span is highlighted (with <p>),
shows this information.  Some of the attribute-value pairs are
suppressed by default, because they are intended just for use by the
frontend.  You can see them if you wish by changing the setting of the
Cedille Mode Debug customization variable; to do this, use keystroke <$>
from Cedille navigation mode to see customization options, or do
‘customize-group’ ‘cedille’.

Spans for file ‘F’ are cached in a ‘F.cede’ file written to a ‘.cedille’
subdirectory of ‘F’’s directory.  Spans are stored and transmitted to
the frontend in JSON format.  Hence, one can easily read the span data
directly – but you will find that it is very verbose and much easier to
understand through the emacs mode.

The ‘se-mode’ (“structured editing”, though it is really just structured
navigation) part of the elisp code is concerned with processing the
spans and assembly an abstract syntax tree based on span containment.
‘se-mode’ is generic, and can be used as the basis for structured
navigation for other languages.  ‘se-mode’ was proposed, designed, and
implemented by (then) U. Iowa undergraduate Carl Olson, before the
current Cedille implementation began.

2.2 Spine-local type inference
==============================

Cedille implements a novel form of local type inference due to Chris
Jenkins, called spine-local type inference.  Cedille will try to fill in
omitted values for type variables via first-order matching (not
unification).  There is currently some heuristic support for
second-order matching, but a complete second-order matcher (note that
second-order matching is decidable, unlike second-order unification) is
planned for after the 1.0 release.  The inference is local in the sense
that type meta-variables are never propagated out of a locale, which is
an application spine (i.e., head applied to arguments).  Spine-local
type inference also uses the expected type for a locale to fill in
missing values for type variables used in the type of the locale.  For
more information, see the paper on ArXiv.
(https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10383) See also some examples in
‘language-overview/type-inference.ced’.  When in Cedille navigation
mode, use keystroke <m> to view the meta-variables buffer, where
information on meta-variables and their current solutions (if any) is
shown; when this buffer is shown, the locale will also be highlighted in
the Cedille source buffer.

2.3 File structure and modules
==============================

A Cedille source file consists first of a header consisting of optional
module imports (‘import X.’), then a module declaration for the file
(‘module X(params)’), and then more optional imports.  The parameters
can be term- or type-level, and one can indicate erased term-level
parameters with curly braces.  For an example of a module parametrized
by a type of natural numbers mod 2:

‘module X(A : ★)(z : A)(s : A ➔ A){p : { z ≃ s (s z) }} .’

After the header, the file consists of term, type, or kind definitions.

Modules may be partially applied.

23 cedille-mode options
***********************

The options file resides in ~/.cedille/options and consists of a list of
options, each on its own line, with a terminating period (“.”).  The
available options are:

‘import-directories "/path/to/dir"’
     This specifies a directory where Cedille will search for imported
     files.  Any number of directories may be listed, each on its own
     line.  They will be searched after the current directory.
     Currently, it is not recommended to have two files with the same
     name.

‘use-cede-files = [true/false]’
     Enables/disables the Cedille backend’s use of .cede files

‘make-rkt-files = [true/false]’
     Enables/disables the Cedille backend’s generation of .rkt files

‘generate-logs = [true/false]’
     Enables/disables generation of log files (.cedille/log)

‘show-qualified-vars = [true/false]’
     Enables/disables the printing of fully-qualified variables

‘erase-types = [true/false]’
     Sets whether or not types are erased before they are displayed, for
     convenience.

24 Roadmap
**********

Cedille is under active development, and the following major changes are
planned.  Cedille 1.1 will probably be Fall 2018 (we are not too far
from done with the datatype notations).  Cedille 1.2 is likely Winter
2018 or Spring 2019.  Cedille 2.0 is hopefully Summer 2019, but we are
still immersed in the basic research for that.

   • Datatype declarations and pattern-matching recursion, compiled to a
     Mendler lambda-encoding, Cedille 1.1
   • Second-order matching and term inference incorporated into
     spine-local type inference, Cedille 1.2
   • Rebase Cedille on sequent calculus to enable deriving types like
     existentials as dual to universals, and support constructive
     control operators, Cedille 2.0

For datatype notations, we have, in a number of papers and works in
progress, devised semantics in Cedille for various somewhat advanced
features: histomorphic recursion, inductive-recursive types, and
inductive-inductive types.  We will be gradually incorporating
high-level syntax for these into Cedille, starting with histomorphic
recursion.
